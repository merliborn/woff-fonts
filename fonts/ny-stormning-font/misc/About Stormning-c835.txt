Stormning is a Runic font with Nordic runes from 4 Scandinavian alphabetic systems and 1 Scandinavian Numeral system that are used as equivalents to Latin Characters.

Most Characters are from the ancient norse Elder Futhark and later norse Younger Futhark runic alphabets, the other runes are from the later Medieval and Swedish Dalecarlian Runic alphabets.

The Numbers are the Norse Pentamal Numeric system, which works a lot like the Roman Numeral System.

There is almost no punctuation, as the Runes only had very limited punctuation.

The symbols that look like centered dots and Maltese Cross were both used as equivalents to commas, and the symbol that looks like a colon was used as an equivalent to the Period/Full Stop in the Latin alphabet.

As an equivalent to the at sign (@), the "A" and "T" characters were combined together as a ligature of sorts, but this was not used in the actual Norse alphabets, this was made up for this font as a way to add a minute bit of practicality to it.
